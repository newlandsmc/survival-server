# SemiVanilla MC

This repo contains the actual server configs. Do not touch.

In theory this can be pulled down to restore a blank-slate new instance of the server at any point. We'll see how that goes... the .gitignore is going to get complicated, fast.

If this is used for deploying a new copy of the server - jars will have to be re-downloaded! [Server wiki](https://github.com/SemiVanilla-MC/wiki) listing active plugins and server version should be kept updated!
