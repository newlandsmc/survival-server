# Below are config settings that change the chance the plugin uses to find valid targets.
# ([Days Player Awake] - [@DaysAwake - 1]) * [@TimeAwakeMultiplier] * [@RandomChance]
# 0.0 to 1.0 is 0% to 100% chance. 0.3 = 30% chance. 0.9 = 90% chance.

# The chance of an event playing will increase by this much every day. So 3 days, with 3.0 means 9.0 multiplier
# This can be set to 0 or lower to disable.
# This will start at 0 after "DaysAwake" days, so 5 days awake, minus 3... 2 days awake.
TimeAwakeMultiplier: 3.0
# The max multiplier the plugin will hit, otherwise it could start spamming them. Default means 4 days.
TimeAwakeMaxMultiplier: 15.0

# If the player's last rest time has been set to more recent than before... It plays this message.

# This is the chance of the sound playing every second, so 0.01 = 1% chance

# This is where it finds a location to play the sounds at.
# What's the closest the block picked can be, 1 means the block next to them can be picked
