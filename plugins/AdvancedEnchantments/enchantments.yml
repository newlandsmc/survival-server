#        # You can use tags <random number>x-y</random number> while x < y, it will generate a random number between two given integers.
#        # e.g.: "STEAL_MONEY:<random number>10000-50000</random number>"
#        # Use <chance>x</chance> to set per-effect chance, x being a chance percentage.
#        # e.g.: "POTION:SPEED:1:100 %attacker% <chance>25</chance>"

#        # You also may use %victim% or %attacker% flag to give effects to different players (in ATTACK, BOW, DEATH, KILL_PLAYER and DEFENSE types).
#        # Example usage: - "POTION:POISON:1:50 %attacker%', this will give Level 2 POISON potion effect to the player who attacked.
#        # If none is provided, effects will be given to the player who had custom enchanted item.
#        # You can add %combo% instead of numbers, to use number of combo's player has (eg. to limit combo number: "%combo% > 0 && %combo% < 5 : %continue%')
