CMD_BLACKLIST_WORD_HOVER=&c/chatfilter blacklist add word <word>&r \n&7Blocks a new word from chat, once added players will not be able to say the word in chat. Chat messages containing any part of this word will be blocked from chat.\n&7You can change this with boundaries, they're labelled as '&f#&7'. Example use: &f#hello&7 - This use of the boundary would allow players to say '&fabcHELLO&7' due to the boundary being at the beginning of the word '&fhello&7'\n&bMore examples&f: \n&f#hello#&7 - This would prevent from &fabc&aHELLO&fabc&7 being caught by the filter because &fhello&7 has a boundary on both sides\n&fhello#&7 - This would prevent &aHELLO&fabc &7from being caught by the filter because &fhello&7 has a boundary at the end.\n&f#hello&7 - This would prefevnt &fabc&aHELLO&7 from being caught by the filter because &fhello&7 has a boundary at the beginning.
